# Human Activity Recognition with Triaxial Accelerometers using Deep Learning

The notebooks contain the code for a complete system for recognising human activities using a convolutional neural network. It included data acquisition, features extraction, data processing, training and activity classification. This web app folder contains the source code for a simple web application that takes temporal sequences of triaxial accelerometer data to provide activity classifications.
